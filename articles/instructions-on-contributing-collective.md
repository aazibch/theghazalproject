While a ghazal traditionally has a single author, here, at [The Ghazal Project](/), we would like to celebrate the beauty of the English ghazal by fostering a sense of shared creativity and connection. Our platform’s [Collective Ghazal](/collective-ghazal) feature allows users from around the world to join in crafting a single, continuous poem. Below are instructions and guidelines for contributing to this unique project:

- Our ghazal ends in the refrain word “silence.” When you contribute, ensure that only the second line of your couplet ends with “silence.” This is because only the opening stanza ends both of its lines with the refrain, and that is already provided. For reference, here’s the opening stanza: _“To understand my words one must know silence, / For these words emerge from the womb of silence.”_
- While traditional ghazals often adhere to strict metrical patterns, our ghazal is designed to be accessible and inclusive. Therefore, metrical precision is not required. However, to maintain a sense of rhythm and balance, the two lines of your couplet should be roughly equal in length. To aid contributors in achieving this balance, we require each line of your entry to be at least 30 characters and no more than 60 characters in length.
- In a traditional ghazal, the poet often includes their signature in the final couplet as a way of personalizing the poem. However, because this is a collaborative project and we are still accepting contributions, we recommend avoiding signatures in your entries.

### Some Helpful Tips

To ensure your couplet flows seamlessly within the collective poem, consider the following:

- **Reflect on the Refrain**: The word “silence” is rich with meaning and symbolism. Explore themes like introspection, mystery, peace, absence, or even contradiction to add depth to your couplet.
- **Craft Autonomy**: Each couplet in a ghazal is an independent thought or image. While it need not directly connect to other couplets, it should feel harmonious within the overall theme of the ghazal.
- **Maintain Balance**: In traditional ghazals, punctuation is rarely used. Avoid overcrowding your lines with excessive details. Aim for simplicity and elegance while staying within the character limits.

### Conclusion

The _Collective Ghazal_ is a celebration of diversity and shared creativity. Whether you’re an experienced poet or trying your hand at the ghazal for the first time, your voice is welcome here. By contributing a couplet, you become part of a larger narrative, one that spans cultures, perspectives, and emotions.

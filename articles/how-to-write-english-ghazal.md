The ghazal is a poetic form that originated in Arabic and found its fullest expression in Persian and Urdu literature. It consists of a series of couplets, each of which is autonomous yet connected through thematic resonance. In this guide, we explore three variations of the ghazal. We also discuss the importance of meter and offer examples from Aazib Chaudhry’s poems to illustrate the art of crafting a ghazal.

### The Structure of a Ghazal

Before delving into specific forms, let’s outline the essential characteristics of a ghazal:

1. **Couplets**: A ghazal is composed of at least five couplets. Each couplet (called a sher) is a self-contained thought.
2. **Thematic Unity**: While each couplet is independent, the poem as a whole often explores variations of a central theme, such as love, loss, or spirituality.
3. **Rhyme and Refrain**: The rhymed word (qaafiya) and refrain (radif) are crucial elements in some forms. They create rhythm and resonance.
4. **Meter**: Although modern ghazals can be free verse, traditional ghazals follow a metrical pattern. Even if you choose to forgo meter, it is best if each line of the poem is of roughly equal length.
5. **Closing Signature**: In the final couplet (maqta), poets traditionally mention their name or pen name (takhallus), lending a personal touch to the composition.

### 1. Refrain-Rhymed Ghazal

This is how the ghazals are traditionally written. The first couplet (matla) establishes the rhyme and refrain. Both lines of the first couplet and the second line of every subsequent couplet end with the rhymed word followed by the refrain.

In the example below are the first two couplets of a ghazal poem:

<div class="poetryStanza">

_"I sought the rarest of jewels for you, my dear,_

_Of mystical origins known to few, my dear._

</div>

<div class="poetryStanza">

_Each ray of moonlight threatened me with loneliness,_

_But beauty beckoned in the morning dew, my dear."_

</div>

As you can see, the phrase, “my dear” is the refrain, whereas the words “you,” “few,” and “dew” are the rhymes.

#### How to Write a Refrain-Rhymed Ghazal:

1. **Choose a refrain**: Pick a short, evocative phrase that will conclude the second line of each couplet.
2. **Find a rhyme**: Select words that will rhyme immediately before the refrain.
3. **Craft in meter (optional)**: For this form, adhering to a consistent metrical pattern enhances its musicality.
4. **Focus on self-contained couplets**: Each couplet should stand alone while contributing to the poem’s overall mood or theme.

### 2. Refrain Ghazal

In the refrain form, the refrain appears at the end of each line of the opening couplet and the second line of every subsequent couplet. However, there is no rhyme preceding the refrain.

The example below shows the first two couplets of a poem that uses the word “moon” as its refrain:

<div class="poetryStanza">

_"Aberrant stars adorn the sky awaiting the full moon._

_They sparkle in their fervor to behold the gracious moon._

</div>

<div class="poetryStanza">

_My weary eyes had barely closed when I was roused again._

_What urgent matter am I yet to settle with the moon?"_

</div>

#### How to Write a Refrain Ghazal:

1. **Select a refrain**: Choose a compelling phrase that can evoke varied emotions and interpretations.
2. **Omit rhyme**: Without the constraint of rhyme, this form allows greater flexibility in diction and imagery.
3. **Consider meter**: While free verse is possible, using meter maintains the lyrical quality of the ghazal.

### 3. Rhymed Ghazal

In the rhymed form, the first couplet and the second line of each subsequent couplet end with rhyming words. This form forgoes the refrain, making it particularly well-suited for English poetry, where strict refrains can sometimes feel forced.

The example shows the first two stanzas of a poem:

<div class="poetryStanza">

_"I see a temple to my left, a mosque towards my right._

_Between the two I've built my tavern of divine delight._

</div>

<div class="poetryStanza">

_Into the darkness of the moonless night the drunkards go._

_By God, the tavern’s lantern is the only lamp in sight."_

</div>

The rhymed words used in the first stanza are “right” and “delight,” followed by “sight” in the next stanza.

#### How to Write a Rhymed Ghazal:

1. **Pick a rhyme**: Select a set of rhyming words to close the couplets (and the first line).
2. **Skip the refrain**: Without the refrain, the focus shifts to maintaining a coherent rhyme while allowing diverse expressions.
3. **Choose a metrical scheme (recommended)**: The absence of a refrain allows for innovative storytelling, but it can also make the poem feel disjointed. To maintain coherence and unity, it is recommended that you use a metrical scheme.

### Meter

While modern poets may experiment with free verse, a ghazal in meter retains its musicality and classical charm. Meter provides a scaffold that enhances the rhythmic quality, particularly for the rhymed variant. Lines of six to eight iambic feet are ideal for crafting couplets that are concise yet impactful.

### Customary Final Couplet

Traditionally, ghazal poets include their name or pen name in the final couplet, offering a personal reflection or signature.

Here’s an example:

<div class="poetryStanza">

_"If someone asks who Aazib is tell them to read these words,_

_For in his baffling verses he has made his nature plain."_

</div>

### Parting Remarks

Writing a ghazal requires a blend of precision and creativity. Whichever variant of the ghazal you choose, the key lies in maintaining the integrity of the couplets while weaving a subtle thematic thread through the poem. With practice and attention to form, you can master this timeless art and bring the beauty of the ghazal to life.
